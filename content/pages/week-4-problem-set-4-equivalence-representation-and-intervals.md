These questions will help strengthen your understanding of what we might mean by equal pitches/notes, and get a better sense of how pitches and durations (a) might be represented and (b) are represented in `music21,` and (3) figure out why working with intervals is so hard.

Note: there is a property on Note and Pitch objects called `diatonicNoteNum` which you may **not** use in this problem set. However, you may use it after this problem set, so feel free to learn what it is and why it might be important.
