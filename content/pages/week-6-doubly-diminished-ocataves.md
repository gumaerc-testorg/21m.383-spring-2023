I was once asked after teaching a class on weird intervals if I knew of any examples of a doubly diminished or doubly augmented octave in a piece of tonal music. I responded off the top of my head with John Philip Sousa's march *The Thunderer*, but that piece in fact begins with a singly augmented octave.  I'm pretty sure there's an example of a double-augmented octave somewhere in another piece by Sousa, but I couldn't find it.

I searched the music21 corpus for any other examples  (just looking for Bb against B#) and I found two, both in string quartets by Beethoven.  In his Opus 59 no 3, movement 1, there is a doubly-diminished octave where (in the last measure of this excerpt) the cello plays B# against the Bb of violin 1:

and in his quartet Opus 18 no 3, there is a doubly-augmented octave between the other two instruments, Viola and Violin 2:

but then I looked for doubly diminished octaves on other notes and found several more (the last column is the note, so "G" = "G# to Gb")
