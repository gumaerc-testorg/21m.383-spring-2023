### **Class 3**

*Asynchronous Material*

We will switch back to our first real topic to encourage us to think of ways that we might represent pitch and duration and how our choices of representation affect what sorts of manipulations, queries, or art we might be able to make given our choices. The first task is considering the consequences of pitch not being a fundamental computational structure in any general-purpose programming language.

Consider some ways you might go about representing pitch. Now let’s go into a little bit more depth on pitch representation through this video on the pros and cons of certain formats and the stakeholders:

Discussion: Describe three ways you might represent pitch for a computer. Give some stakeholders that might be helpful for one and not for others, as well as tradeoffs of one vs. another. Can you—in just ten minutes—come up with one that is perfect?
