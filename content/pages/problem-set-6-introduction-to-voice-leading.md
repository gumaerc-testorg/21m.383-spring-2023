Problem Set 6 was created using interactive features in MIT's Canvas LMS to combine 10 video components totaling 34 minutes of video content with a sort of PSet-style work. Students could work on the assignment in Jupyter or another IDE and then copy and paste (code) answers into Canvas. This problem set is not included here.
