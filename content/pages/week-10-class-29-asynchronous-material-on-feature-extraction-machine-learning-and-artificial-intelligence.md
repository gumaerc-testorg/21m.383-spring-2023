The video is paced so you can only type along and pause when something doesn't work. It was originally filmed in 2020, but I have updated it for this year and music21 v7. Some commands are designed for v6 so read the overlays for v7 equivalents. 

Note: I only now learned about the offensive history of the Ryan's fiddle tune corpus and debated re-filming the video with a new corpus, but this would make it so the video would not be available to the class in time, so I have decided to leave it in with a disclaimer for now.

Windows users may need to run `import pathlib; pathlib.PosixPath = pathlib.Path` to make corpus search work.
