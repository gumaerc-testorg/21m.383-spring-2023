Video 26a summarizes vocabulary reduction, key analysis, and the Bach chorales as preparation for the problem set. It goes into more detail than what was discussed in class. Note that the video is a bit out-of-date, so follow the PSet instructions for anything that differs between the video and the PSet assignment.

Towards the end, the `.isConsonant()` method on Chord is mentioned which might be useful. Also, `.analyze('key')` is unlocked and you should use it.
