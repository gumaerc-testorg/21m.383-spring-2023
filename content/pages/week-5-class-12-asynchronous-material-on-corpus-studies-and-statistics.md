Watch the videos below for an introduction to what can be done with a large corpus of lead sheets and texts.

In Video 12a, I'll read my paper with Sophia Sun on this subject. Except for not putting on a tie, I'm presenting this as I would a formal presentation at a conference, with a prepared text and slides that I'm reading almost exclusively from. While it might sound a little more stilted than a class presentation, it can be the best way to present difficult material in a short amount of time. Consider this a model for the short presentations you will give at the end of the term. Note that the video uses some techniques (like automatically detecting the key and mode of a piece) that we have not yet dealt with.

Reading: Sophia Sun and Michael Scott Cuthbert, “{{% resource_link "68476cb1-59d6-4fd5-9602-c25103994fb6" "Emotion Painting: Lyric, Affect, and Musical Relationships in a Large Lead-Sheet Corpus" %}},”  *Empirical Musicology Review* 12.3–4 (2018), pp. 327–48.

Video 12b shows how Bach's chorales (four-voice religious pieces with mostly homophonic motion and chord changes in nearly every beat) can be used as a corpus within music21. Note, in the video, I used the old form "`.flat`" instead of the new form "`.flatten()`"

Once you have a score, you will want some ways of summarizing musical trends within it (as we saw in Cook's Computational and Comparative Musicology article). While you can do that with programming, a much more effective method is by using visualizations. Video 12c describes how to get started with this:

Readings:

Once you've viewed the video, read music21 {{% resource_link "df30ac70-887c-45a7-9239-0ce753bcc96b" "User's Guide, Chapter 22" %}} in more detail. If you want to work with advanced topics, also read {{% resource_link "a90f9fa0-fb2b-4675-9ebb-17f3c2c60fd1" "Chapter 44" %}}.

For more information on the effective use of visual information, skim or read Edward Tufte's book: {{% resource_link "0be416c8-f225-432d-b668-79ca00aba270" "*The Visual Display of Quantitative Information*" %}}, Graphics Press, 2001. ISBN: 9780961392147.

Ties in music21 are a tiny thing, but it's really helpful to know how to work with them. Video 12d explains what you need to know to get started with them:
