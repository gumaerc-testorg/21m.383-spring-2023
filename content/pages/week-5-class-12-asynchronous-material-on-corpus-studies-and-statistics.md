Watch the videos below for an introduction to what can be done with a large corpus of lead sheets and texts.

In Video 12a, I'll read my paper with Sophia Sun on this subject. Except for not putting on a tie, I'm presenting this as I would a formal presentation at a conference, with a prepared text and slides that I'm reading almost exclusively from. While it might sound a little more stilted than a class presentation, it can be the best way to present difficult material in a short amount of time. Consider this a model for the short presentations you will give at the end of the term. Note that the video uses some techniques (like automatically detecting the key and mode of a piece) that we have not yet dealt with.

Reading: Sophia Sun and Michael Scott Cuthbert, “[Emotion Painting: Lyric, Affect, and Musical Relationships in a Large Lead-Sheet Corpus](https://emusicology.org/index.php/EMR/article/view/5889/4974),”  *Empirical Musicology Review* 12.3–4 (2018), pp. 327–48.

Video 12b shows how Bach's chorales (four-voice religious pieces with mostly homophonic motion and chord changes in nearly every beat) can be used as a corpus within music21. Note, in the video, I used the old form "`.flat`" instead of the new form "`.flatten()`"

Once you have a score, you will want some ways of summarizing musical trends within it (as we saw in Cook's Computational and Comparative Musicology article). While you can do that with programming, a much more effective method is by using visualizations. Video 12c describes how to get started with this:

Readings:

Once you've viewed the video, read music21 [User's Guide, Chapter 22](https://web.mit.edu/music21/doc/usersGuide/usersGuide_22_graphing.html) in more detail. If you want to work with advanced topics, also read [Chapter 44](https://web.mit.edu/music21/doc/usersGuide/usersGuide_44_advancedGraphing.html).

For more information on the effective use of visual information, skim or read Edward Tufte's book: [*The Visual Display of Quantitative Information*](https://www.edwardtufte.com/book/the-visual-display-of-quantitative-information/), Graphics Press, 2001. ISBN: 9780961392147.

Ties in music21 are a tiny thing, but it's really helpful to know how to work with them. Video 12d explains what you need to know to get started with them:
