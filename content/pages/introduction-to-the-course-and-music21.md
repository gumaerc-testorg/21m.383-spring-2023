As you proceed through this class, you'll be unlocking features of music21, but what exactly *is* music21, and what do people do with it? Don't trust me on this—I wrote it, so I'm biased. 

Please read this review of music21 by Dmitri Tymoczko, a professor of music at Princeton. His name will return on the first PSet. I agree with some of Tymoczko's review, some I don't, and some I agreed with at the time he wrote, but now it's out of date.
