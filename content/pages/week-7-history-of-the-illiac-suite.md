Read through at least chapters 2–4, skimming parts that are too dense or obscure, of history's first major discussion of algorithmic composition: Lejaren A. Hiller, Jr., and Leonard M. Isaacson, [*Experimental Music: Composition with an Electronic Computer*](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Experimental_Music/dDnQAAAAMAAJ?hl=en) (New York: McGraw Hill, 1959). ISBN: 9789333639651. \[[Read on Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/experimentalmusi00hill/page/n5/mode/2up)\]

This book describes the *Illiac Suite,* composed by but not performed by the ILLIAC computer (Wikipedia: [ILLIAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ILLIAC)). The composition consists of four "experiments" (movements). 

Listen to at least movements 1 and 4:

Discussion: What aspects of the aesthetics and methods of this 65+ year-old experiment are still relevant today, and what aspects have aged out of usefulness?
