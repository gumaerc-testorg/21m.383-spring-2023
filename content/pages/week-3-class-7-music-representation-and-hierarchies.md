Video 7a unlocks music21 Duration, Note Modules, and Objects. Watch this video after completing PSet 1 as it will become useful for PSet 3:

Video 7b provides a one-minute introduction to the differences between Containers (such as Streams) and Leafs (such as Elements or Music21Objects or Notes) as used in computational music theory:

Video 7c covers the main topic of Hierarchies, and a subtopic on that is the particular score hierarchy used in this class, the music21 Stream. This is the first of many introductions to Stream features. You will unlock and use Streams, Corpus, and Meter.

Note: There are a few slight changes to music21 since video 7c. The rest should say `music21.note.Rest eighth`, for instance, and there are some improvements to how we can quickly put things into a stream that will make it simpler to create stream hierarchies, which we will get to later in the class.

Video 7d is a slightly deeper dive into musical representation in general, but Classical Western music notation (CWMN) in particular, with a look at the two major ways of representing polyphonic music: partwise or timewise.
