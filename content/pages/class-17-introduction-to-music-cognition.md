Reading: Krumhansl on Probe Tone

The "Probe Tone Algorithm" was designed by Carol Krumhansl in her book {{% resource_link "11abe6cd-3902-411a-95cb-6e0495d6e7f6" "*Cognitive Foundations of Musical Pitch*" %}} (Oxford, 1990) \[{{% resource_link "69ca7095-2c2a-4127-81eb-dfa1264ac29d" "preview in Google Books" %}}\]. There are amazing discoveries in music cognition in this book and we will return to the psychological and cognition aspects later when we have a particular chapter on music cognition. Music cognition is closely related to empirical studies, and the computer helps to get empirical data. 

Read two excerpts from the book:

{{% resource_link "d58e0e56-3e3c-412f-8a0b-4a2f1ee0cc7f" "Chapter 2" %}}: "The Tonal Hierarchy" and "First Probe Tone Study"

{{% resource_link "57520e32-4a4c-4cc2-9d4b-4b9d83725907" "Chapter 4" %}}: "Key-Finding Algorithm" and "Application I"

Discussion questions on Krumhansl:

What is a probe-tone experiment?

- What might it tell us about how pitches relate to keys?
- How can the results of probe-tone experiments be used to write automatic key detection computer programs?
