Reading: Krumhansl on Probe Tone

The "Probe Tone Algorithm" was designed by Carol Krumhansl in her book [*Cognitive Foundations of Musical Pitch*](https://academic.oup.com/book/40395) (Oxford, 1990) \[[preview in Google Books](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Cognitive_Foundations_of_Musical_Pitch/aJDEVqyArr4C?hl=en)\]. There are amazing discoveries in music cognition in this book and we will return to the psychological and cognition aspects later when we have a particular chapter on music cognition. Music cognition is closely related to empirical studies, and the computer helps to get empirical data. 

Read two excerpts from the book:

[Chapter 2](https://academic.oup.com/book/40395/chapter/347202819): "The Tonal Hierarchy" and "First Probe Tone Study"

[Chapter 4](https://academic.oup.com/book/40395/chapter/347203084): "Key-Finding Algorithm" and "Application I"

Discussion questions on Krumhansl:

What is a probe-tone experiment?

- What might it tell us about how pitches relate to keys?
- How can the results of probe-tone experiments be used to write automatic key detection computer programs?
